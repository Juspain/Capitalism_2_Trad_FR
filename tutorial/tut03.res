[MESSAGE]The guide updates to reflect your choice. If you take Corn you can manufacture Canned Corn. Fairly evident eh? Take a close look at the Corn. Notice that 1 lb of Corn is needed to make 2 units (or cans) of the Canned Corn. Also notice that the Corn has a quality influence of 60%. This means that the overall product is 60% affected by the quality of the Corn.

[MESSAGE]Combined with Sugar, Corn Syrup is used in the manufacture of Chewing Gum. Notice that the MORE button is shaded for the Corn Syrup, indicating that it is only used in chewing gum. Take a quick look at the Production Technology and Raw Material Quality figures. The overall quality of chewing gum is only 25% affected by the quality of the raw materials. This means that you could therefore use fairly low quality raw materials, which tend to be cheaper, to produce gum comparable in quality to a competitor using high quality materials.

[MESSAGE]Your canned corn has an overall quality of 57 out of 100. This is calculated by assessing the influence of several factors. Remember when you looked at the Manufacturer's Guide and discovered that the overall quality of canned corn was 60% affected by the quality of the raw material and 40% affected by the production technology? Look at the other figures quoted.

[WINDOW]432,12,300,200
[HINT]~

[MESSAGE]The Production Quality has a figure of 12/40. The 40 is the 40% just mentioned. This figure is derived from multiplying the current Production Technology of the factory, which is 30, by the percentage concern, which is 40, and then dividing the total by 100 to give 12.

[MESSAGE]A similar calculation is used to determine the Raw Material Quality. From the unit detail section you can see that the raw material quality is 45. This figure is arrived at by multiplying the actual quality of the raw material(s) used by the percentage concern and then dividing the result by 100. Click your corn purchasing unit and look at the unit detail section.

[MESSAGE]The quality of the corn is 75. So the raw material quality calculation is (75 x 60)/100 = 45. Added to the production quality value of 12 it gives an overall product of 57 (out of a maximum of 100).
